Security Coding Review
A secure code review is a process that examines a software's source code for security vulnerabilities. It's an important part of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and can help improve the quality and security of software.
Some benefits of a secure code review include:
.Early detection of vulnerabilities
.Improved code quality
.Reduced risk of security breaches
.Improved collaboration
.Educates developers
.Compliance with industry regulations
Secure code reviews are most effective when performed frequently, after code is committed or a new pull request is executed.
